# Overview
A 40% ortholinear mx mechanical keyboard powered by a proMicro or equivalent.

This keyboard is discontinued. While it should still work, it uses a potentially outdated QMK release and an Amtel AtMega32U4 based promicro, so there may be incompatibilities with newer operating systems (tested for windows 10)
